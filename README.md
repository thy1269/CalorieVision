# Custom YOLOv11 Model Training for Food Detection

This script trains a YOLOv11 model on a custom dataset for food detection using the Ultralytics YOLO library. It initializes a pre-trained YOLOv11 model, trains it on your dataset, and saves the trained weights for future use.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, ensure you have the following:

- **Ultralytics YOLO library**: Install it using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install ultralytics
